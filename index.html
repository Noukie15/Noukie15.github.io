      <p>
        There are two types of shopping cart coins designed by Thomas:
        <strong>ThomCoin</strong> and <strong>TommieToken</strong>. They're 3D-printed, fit perfectly in shopping carts, and each has a unique message on the back. They're not legal tender — but they're worth their weight in gold when you're missing that one coin.

            No more lugging around your shopping basket like a nomad — this coin unlocks not just carts, but a new era of convenience.
            Some say carrying this coin makes you 30% more efficient at shopping. Or at least you'll never have to ask: "Anyone got a coin?"

            You can't trade this token on an exchange, and it's not accepted by Elon Musk – but pop it in a shopping cart and watch the magic happen.
            In a world full of NFTs and DOGE, this is simply a <strong>PMC</strong>: a Physical Money for Carts.

            Maybe you found it on the street. Or in a parking lot. It probably rolled out of someone's pocket or was adopted by a random cart user.
            If you don't need it, pass it on. Or return it to Thomas (who's probably run back to the store 3 times looking for it).

            But don't worry: using it won't get you arrested. It's more symbolic – a little piece of art in circulation, sponsored by Thomas himself.
            Feel free to use it, admire it, photograph it, or return it. (Or all four.)
